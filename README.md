# Carbonara as Code: the recipe for heaven

This is the best recipe you can find in this Universe to cook a delicious
carbonara. Indeed it is not a recipe, it is a guide to awesomeness.

## Ingredients
First rule: grep raw materials make great dishes. This is especially true for
this minimal recipe where the super quality of ingredients is the key.

For 2 people you need:

- 300 gr of **pasta**, best choice are **mezze maniche** or **rigatoni** but you can use **spaghetti** if you like long pasta (please don't break them).
  Best labels are: De Cecco, Garofalo, Del Verde, Rummo. 
  Benedetto Cavalieri if you are cooking dinner for the woman you plan to marry. 
  Another great brand is Rummo:

- 3 very fresh **eggs**. Better if organic. This implies a bit of personale taste: I use one egg yolk for each commensal and one more entire egg. This leads to 3 eggs.
  2 eggs and a third whole egg.

- Salt and pepper. Better if you have raw pepper to freshly shred, it will preserve more taste.

As you can see there are absolutely no cream, no bacon, no hard-boiled eggs.

## Preliminary tasks

### Boil the water!
Fill a pot with water and add a good pinch of cooking salt and start boiling it.

### Guanciale 
Start slicing the guanciale: cut slices from the shorter side. Remove the rind
before.
When you have 3/4 slices start making little pieces from them. The size is
important: they should not be too big nor too small. 40mm x 7mm x 7mm is 
a nice approximation.

Put the pieces in the a preheated pan: we want it to cook very slowly with absolutely
**NO OLIVE OIL NOR BUTTER**. Set a very moderate flame/temperature to avoid overburning it.
It will mold slowly and release its own grease. Its beatiful smell is really mouth watering.

### Pecorino
Start shredding the pecorino in a bowl. I don't give you an exact weight 
since it's a matter of taste. I like it abundant... :) 

### Eggs
Open the eggs in another bowl and shake them slowly and sweetly, you don't want 
to incorporate too much air. Start adding the pepper and a little part of the shredded pecorino 
to the egg and keep blending, until you have a creamy mix (not too much dense yet).

## Core tasks
Check the guanciale, it should become a little crispy but not too much and it 
should have released a lot of grease. Don't overcook or it will become too dry and
thin, loosing the right consistence.
When it's done, take away 2/3 of the guanciale slices from the pan. You will use them
for the final topping when serving the dishes. Put some slices (4/5 pieces are enough) 
and a little spool of its grease in the egg and incorporate. 
This will help to not cook the egg too much later on. 

When the water boils (not before) add the pasta and cook it for the right time 
(the brands I suggested usually need 11-13 minutes). Cook it for two minutes less 
than the suggested time: during the mixing process in the pan the pasta will keep 
on cooking. Don't use a strainer since you want to keep some cooking water 
incorporated, it will help you to obtain a good cream.

Add a very little amount of water in the egg and stir. The purpose is to raise the egg
temperature a bit, without cooking it.

### Creaming time
Jump the pasta and the guanciale together for a minute. Add a first, lovely pinch
of shredded pecorino cheese and some more peper (carbonara without pepper is like
drinking alcohol free beer). Mix with care and energy at the same time. 
Also remember to save an extra glass of cooking water for later use if necessary.

My advice is to put the pan away from the flame since an excessive amount of heat 
will cook the egg too fast with an omelette-like result. Just toss the pasta in the
pan for one minute before adding the egg to slightly lower its temperature.

Put the pecorino cheese in the egg an mix well until you get a quite dense cream. 
We do this as the last step to avoid melting the pecorino before because of the 
warm water or the guanciale grease already added.

Now the hard part where true heroes rise: put the eggs on the pasta and start 
mixing. The rule of thumb is simple: we just don't want to overcook the egg,
it should stay creamy.
When you get a creamy result you are ready to serve. The level of egg cooking is 
something very personal: some people prefer it very rare, some other well done.
Before serving add back the guanciale slices put aside before and let them 
incorporate the egg cream.

**NOTE**: If you prefer the egg to coagulate a bit more, you can try moving back and forth the pan 
on the fire 
Add some other shredded pecorino and pepper if you like it, since the real taste 
of the carbonara is very strong with a lot of pepper. 
If it becomes too tight we can add a very small amount of cooking water and keep on mixing.

### Serving
Serve the pasta in you favorite dishes. Add some more guanciale slices on top of it.
Add a small amount of pecorino on the dish and pepper to decorate.

Your carbonara is ready. Taste galore!
